Difference between GitHub Repository and Project
Tool


- A repository is a tool built on top of Git.

It is like a folder that contains all the files needed for your project, including the files that keep track of all the versions of your projects so that you can always go back to the previous state if you screw something up on the way.

It keeps track of your project history and who has made what changes, when and why. Projects are a great issue management feature in GitHub which helps you organize issues and pull requests into a Kanban-style board for better visualization and prioritization of work.


Role

 – A Git repository is a .git/folder inside a project which creates an entire history of your project including all the changes made to the project since the beginning.

It is the main staging area where your projects live or the versions of the project. So, if you delete the .git folder then you delete your entire work history.


Git has a local repository that stores all the changes locally on your personal computer or laptop, whereas a remote repository stores all the files in a remote location in one of the servers located miles away.


Projects board, on the other hand, allows you to manage your workflow across a repository, visualizing the progress and tasks for a project.
