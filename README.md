# Pre-workshop setup

Please setup an account for the following platforms depending on your personal goals

| Accounts to obtain | Goals |
| :-- | :-- |
| Google | ... if you would like to save your work done during the workshop |
| Google, GitHub, Streamlit | ... if you would like to get the most out of the workshop |
| Google, [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Streamlit](streamlit.io), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) | ... if you would like to try out everything that was mentioned during the workshop |

It will be fine to arrive without any accounts setup, in which case your work on Google Colab can be exported before you leave the workshop.
