Below are some suggestions made on 2024-03-25.

First, the docker tutorials I think I've used before:
1-https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-docker-how-to-create-your-first-docker-application-cc03de9b639f/
2-https://docker-curriculum.com/
 
These were for docker. If one is coding in R, they can use Rocker.
1-https://rocker-project.org/

Python to R:
1-https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/vignettes/python_primer.html (R to python)
2-https://towardsdatascience.com/the-starter-guide-for-transitioning-your-python-projects-to-r-8de4122b04ad (python to R)

Add Quarto to reproducible research: https://quarto.org/

Also, it may be interesting to discuss the different IDEs, notebooks and main differences( pros, cons, compatibility with programming language, operating system, etc.)

I suggest adding some links pointing to a debugging tutorial for each IDE. I can help look for these links and add them.
